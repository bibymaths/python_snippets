# Bioinformatics Tools and Scripts

This repository contains various Python scripts developed for bioinformatics research, with a focus on data analysis, evaluation, and transformation. These tools cater to different aspects of biological data processing, including transcription counts, nucleotide evaluation, and protein-based analyses.

## Repository Contents

1. **`aa_score_ranking.py`**: Evaluates amino acid scores and ranks them based on specific criteria.
2. **`mathematical_operators_eval.py`**: Performs mathematical evaluations, focusing on specific operations for bioinformatics datasets.
3. **`nucleotide_count.py`**: Counts and analyzes nucleotide compositions in DNA sequences.
4. **`aa_charge_to_fasta.py`**: Converts amino acid charge data into FASTA format for downstream analysis.
5. **`transcription_counts.py`**: Processes transcription count data for gene expression studies.

## Usage

Each script is self-contained and focuses on a specific data processing task. To use these scripts:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the script of interest and execute it in a Python environment:
   ```bash
   python <script_name>.py
   ```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages (can be installed using `requirements.txt` if provided)

## Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Scripts are independent, allowing focused use based on task requirements.
- **Bioinformatics Focus**: Tailored for common bioinformatics data transformations and evaluations.
- **Extensibility**: Easy to adapt and integrate into larger workflows.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to improve existing scripts or add new functionalities, please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
